1.Describe the characteristics of Big data in detail
   1.Volume:

        In Big Data,a particular data can be considered as Big Data or not is depending upon the volume of data
   
   2.Variety:

        It defines the type and nature of data.for example structured data and unstructured data
   
   3.Velocity:

        It defines the speed of data processing for meeting all the demands and challenges.
   
   4.Veracity

        It defines the uncertainty of the data and trustworthiness of data

   5.Value:

        It refers to the benefit of using big Data.

2. Explain the possible solutions to handle Big data.
    
     Scale-up:

          1.we cannot retrieve the file when failure occurs.
          2.Parallel processing is used for processing the resources.

     scale-out:

           1.we can retrieve the file when failure occurs.
           2.It divides the large amount of data into small pieces before processing.

3.Explain the differences between scaling up and scaling out

     Scale-up:

          1.Scale-up means adding resources to a single node in a system.
          2.we cannot retrieve the file when failure occurs.
          3.Parallel processing is used for processing the resources.

     scale-out:

          1.Scale-out means adding more nodes to a system.
          2.we can retrieve the file when failure occurs.
          3.It divides the large amount of data into small pieces before processing.
